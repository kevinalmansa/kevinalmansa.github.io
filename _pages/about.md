### Who Am I?

I am an Information Security professional with an MSc in Computer Security,
and two undergraduate degrees. One degree focusing on System Administration &
Networking, the other a three year BSc focusing on Software Development.

I have professional experience in Systems & Network Security, IAM, Web
Development, and System Administration (Linux & Windows). I am a confident
programmer and have  experience coding for and both Linux & Windows environments
across multiple technologies.

I love discovering and learning about how systems and infrastructures are
designed and truly function.

My current interests include Systems and Network Security, Application Security,
Reverse Engineering, Vulnerability Research and Obfuscation / Anti-Debug
techniques.

This blog grants me a place to post and explain topics, concepts, systems and
tools I find interesting. It also serves as a location I use for personal
resources and to discuss tools I develop.
