### Who Am I?

I have recently graduated from the University of Kent with a MSc in Computer
Security, with two undergraduate degrees, one focusing on System Administration
& Networking, the other a three year BSc focusing on Programming.

I have worked in IAM, Web Development, and System Administration.

My Interests include Pentesting, Programming, everything Linux and I am finally
starting to get my feet wet in Reversing.

I love discovering and learning about new technologies and how systems and
infrastructures function.

This blog will allow me to post and explain new concepts, systems and tools as
I discover them.
