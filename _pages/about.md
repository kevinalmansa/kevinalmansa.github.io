### Who Am I?

I have recently graduated from the University of Kent with a MSc in Computer
Security, and possess two undergraduate degrees, one focusing on System
Administration & Networking, and the other a three year BSc focusing on
Programming.

I have professional experience in IAM, Web Development, and System
Administration. I am confident programmer and have experience coding for and
administrating Linux & Windows environments.

I love discovering and learning about new technologies and how systems and
infrastructures function.

My current interests include Vulnerability Research & Application Security,
Reverse Engineering, Malware Analysis and any CTF I can join. :)

This blog will allow me to post and explain topics, concepts, systems and tools
I find interesting as well as serve as a location I use for personal resources
and to discuss tools I develop.
